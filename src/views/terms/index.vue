							M. PROVIDE CASH INCENTIVES. Linkcloudsurvey offers cash incentives

							corresponding offer, it will take up to 8 weeks to receive the
							cash funds from the advertiser. Please do not delete the
							confirmation emails you receive from the advertisers. These
							confirmation emails are required in order for us to investigate if
							your account is not credited in 8 weeks. The funds will be sent to
							the paypal e-mail address registered on file with linkcloudsurvey.
							If your e-mail address changes and funds have already been sent to
							your e-mail address on file, linkcloudsurvey cannot redirect the
							funds to your new address. You can change your paypal e-mail
							address in linkcloudsurvey at any time. PayPal.com is a FREE

						<div class="ml-2 mt-2">
							N.3, FRAUD USERS, Recently we have found that many of our users
							are creating fake accounts and using fraudulent credit cards to
							sign up for surveys. This is causing our sponsors to shut down
							their merchant accounts, and stop business with us sometime
							resulting in no payment. As a result, we will be paying all of our
							members 30 days after approval of the transaction so we have
							enough time to sift through the fraudulent users who cause this,
							with helpful information from our advertisers.

						<div class="ml-2 mt-2">
							N.4, We will be taking legal action if we find any of our members
							having dummy accounts (more than one [1]) per house hold (as
							stated in our terms and conditions) or people using prepaid or
							fraudulent credit cards with our sponsors (advertisers). If you
							are found to have done any of the above stated points, your
							account will be terminated with all earnings being held, plus any
							necessary legal action.
