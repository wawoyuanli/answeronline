						conditions of this Agreement are fully met and they become Earned
						Points as described below.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-3 text-left">
						<label class="h6">B. Earned Points</label>
						- Once all terms and conditions of this Agreement are met and the
						Member actually chooses to redeem the Points and directs how the

						not represent a contract right or claim and have no cash or monetary

						Member at the Site, if Member does not respond to the Site emails or
						survey invitations for a period of eighteen (18) consecutive months

						2. Agreement to Conduct Transactions by Email
					</p>
					<div class="text-left">
						You agree that all of your transactions with the Site (and the
						Site's transactions with you) will be conducted by email or similar
						electronic communications (this is imperative because the economics
						of online panels simply do not permit communication by regular mail
						or telephone). If you need to contact us by phone, or if we need to
						contact you, you agree that phone conversations (if any) may be
						recorded. Regardless of method of transaction or contact, all of the
						terms of this Agreement remain the same. If the law allows you to
						withdraw this consent or if we are ever required to handle
						transactions or communications non-electronically (or if electronic
						communications increase in cost or are taxed), we reserve the right
						to charge your Member Account to cover any such incremental
						communication costs. You agree to update the information in your
						Member Account at least every 12 months (or more often if necessary)
						so that the information therein is current, accurate, and true. You
						agree to maintain your correct and current email address in Member
						Account at all times, and understand that failure to maintain a
						correct email address means your Member Account will become
						Non-Compliant and that you will not earn the Points that may have
						accumulated in your Member Account, as explained in section 8.J. You
						further understand and agree that your failure to respond to email
						or similar electronic communications from the Site for a period of
						eighteen (18) consecutive months or thirty (30) consecutive
						occasions and failure to respond to notice thereof for a period of
						30 days is a breach of this Agreement and means that your Member
						Account will become Non-Compliant and that you will not earn the
						Points that may have accumulated in your Member Account.

						questionnaire, referred to as a "survey" (further described below in

						screeners will award Points, and your account may be credited 5 to
						50 Points, depending on the time it takes to complete, as well as
						being subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. At the
						time you take the screening questionnaire or screener, you will be

						Points to 5,000 Points, based on the estimated time needed to
						complete the survey. At the time you are invited to complete the

						group discussions or online discussion forums or may be asked to
						visit stores or restaurants or complete other assigned tasks. For

						It is your responsibility to keep your email address current and
						accurate in your Link Cloud Survey Member Account.

						Account, as explained in 8.J. You further agree that the Site may
						from time to time attach script to its emails to help ensure that
						you are receiving and opening emails from the Site. GLOBALTON

						the Points, i.e., contribute to a charity, trade for other rewards
						or incentives, participate in promotional offers, or redeem for cash
						(check or Paypal). Until you reach the 1,000-Point minimum and until
						you choose what to do with the Points, the Points are Unearned and

						incentives. To do this, we verify name and mailing address, along
						with survey responses on paid surveys. We also verify that each
						response is answered in a reasonable time period and that responses
						are not invalidated due to "cheater traps" or other deceitful means,
						as this breaks our member agreement to ensure honest answers. This
						process could take up to 30 days. Once validated, GLOBALTON CONSULTING INC
						 will process your transaction within 6 to 8 weeks.

							"denied," or "returned," we will notify you by email and mail a
							check to you.

						Earned Points, you will always have the option to donate your Points
						to any one of the charities listed on the Site. Donations to these

						Please note that Link Cloud Survey is a provider of

					<div class="text-left mb-2 mt-2">
						The CDA provides that when a user writes and posts material on a
						website such as the Site, the website itself cannot, in most cases,
						be held legally responsible for the posted material. Specifically,
						47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1) states, "No provider or user of an interactive
						computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any
						information provided by another information content provider."
						Because the comments and opinions on the Site are authored by users
						of the Site, we cannot be legally regarded as the "publisher or
						speaker" of the content contained here, and hence we are not liable
						for the content even if it contains false or inaccurate information.

						Any dispute arising between you and Link Cloud Survey
						(whether grounded in contract, tort, statute, law or equity) or
						relating in any way to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall
						be finally determined by binding arbitration administered by the
						American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its
						Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in
						Tarrant County, Texas, before a single arbitrator appointed in
						accordance with the applicable rules of the AAA. Judgment on the
						award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
						jurisdiction thereof. Discovery during the arbitration shall be
						conducted pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and shall
						be limited to the exchange of relevant documents and depositions of
						the Parties. No Party is precluded from seeking and obtaining
						injunctive or other emergency relief, and the election to do so by a
						Party shall not be construed as a waiver of arbitration.
					</div>
					<div class="text-left mt-2 mb-2">
						Any dispute must be raised within one (1) year after the date the
						cause of action arose. Failure to provide the written documentation
						within this timeframe will render all claims related to the dispute
						null and void.
